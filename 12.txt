Every F1 team designs their cars to meet regulations the FIA specify in advance that cover almost every aspect of development from the engine performance to tyre pressures.
The genius of F1 is how the engineers interpret the rules and create a vehicle that adheres to the regulations while finding innovative ways to maximise performance they hope rival teams may miss.
The Formula 1 regulations detail everything, including a car's minimum weight (796 kg), the size of the rear-view mirrors (150x50 mm), how much fuel must be available to sample after a race (one litre), and the areas an engineer can – and cannot – have design freedom in when it comes to aerodynamic design.
If you're ever in the mood for some light reading, the FIA publishes all the regulations the teams follow on their website, so you can casually browse the 177 pages (at the time of writing) at your leisure.
