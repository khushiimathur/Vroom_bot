The Grand Prix is the culmination of all of the weekendâ€™s running, where the drivers race each other to be the first to cross the finish line after 305 km of running.
Rules dictate how drivers must conduct themselves when racing. For example, F1 is a non-contact sport, and drivers cannot push a rival off the race track. Each driver must also keep at least one wheel within the white painted line that defines a track's limits.
Other rules are more procedural, such as running two sets of tyres during the race and maintaining enough fuel for the FIA to test a sample after the Grand Prix concludes.
