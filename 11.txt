Introduced in 2011, the Drag Reduction System, commonly initialised as DRS, refers to an opening in the rear wing that lowers the air resistance as an F1 car speeds around the circuit.The intention behind DRS's introduction is to encourage more overtaking during a race and increase entertainment for fans.
By reducing the drag, an F1 car can travel faster than it otherwise would, making it easier to close in on any competing driver whose car is not using DRS.
DRS is only usable in designated 'zones', usually straight sections of the track, and the driver cannot activate the system at any other point on their lap. During Free Practice and Qualifying, DRS is available for drivers anytime they enter the DRS zone.
However, to benefit from the system in a race, they must be within one second of the car in front at a detection point before the zone begins. The car in front can be the rival they are chasing or a driver one lap behind.
