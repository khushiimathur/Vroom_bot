The four tyres on an F1 car come in five variations known as compounds, although they are all simple rubber discs at their core.
Drivers race on tyres without tread, known as slicks, in dry conditions. These come in soft, medium and hard compounds, with the soft offering the most grip but the least durability and vice versa for the hard.
Wet and intermediate tyres also exist, but these grooved tyres are only used when it rains or the track is damp from earlier rainfall.
In a dry race, each driver must use at least two sets of the slick compounds before they finish the Grand Prix or else the FIA will disqualify them.
