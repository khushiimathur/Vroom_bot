The pit lane homes all ten competing F1 teams and serves as the only point where anyone other than the driver may touch the car once the race begins.
It is here during a race where a team will change a driver's tyres, perform any repairs, or make rudimentary setup changes to the car to help with performance.
A driver may perform as many pit stops as they wish during a race, but due to their time-intensive nature, they will seek to minimise the number of pit lane trips they make.
Equally, a pit stop can take as long as is necessary as there are no maximum time limits, but a driver will want to remain in the pit lane for as little time as possible to finish the race quicker.
However, there are minimum time limits for safety reasons in an effort to reduce the likelihood of mistakes as pit crews rush to achieve the fastest possible pit stops.
