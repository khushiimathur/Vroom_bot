Free Practice allows the drivers to experience and familiarise themselves with a track and test different car setups in non-competitive sessions on Fridays and Saturdays.
A standard race weekend has three Free Practice sessions, each lasting one hour, with two on Friday and one on Saturday before Qualifying.
Some race weekends will host a shorter race called Sprint, detailed below. These only have two Free Practice sessions; one on Friday and one on Saturday.
