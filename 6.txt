Introduced in 2021, Sprint is a short-form race lasting 100 km that replaces the third Free Practice session at some race weekends.
2024 sees six Sprint events in China, Miami, Austria, the United States (Austin, Texas), Brazil and Qatar.
The format for Sprint weekends this season is still to be confirmed, so make sure that you download the official Williams app and turn notifications on to be some of the first to know.
