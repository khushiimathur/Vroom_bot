Each Grand Prix begins with a formation lap where the drivers make their way around the circuit at a slower-than-usual speed before lining up on the starting grid.
Once the final driver takes their place at their defined starting position, five red lights above the starting line will illuminate sequentially to countdown the race's start. When all five lights simultaneously go out, the Grand Prix begins.
The time between each light switching on is the same, but there is a random delay each time from the fifth light's illumination and them all switching off. This variation means a driver's reaction time is crucial to get the edge over their competitors.
