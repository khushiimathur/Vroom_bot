International venues host grands prix to create a season with a varying number of races each year. There isn't a defined minimum or maximum season length, although there is a distinct upward trend of races per season as the years go by.
Every location that hosts a Grand Prix must meet the strictest safety rules set out by the FIA, F1's governing body, to protect both drivers and attending fans. If you follow football (or soccer, should you prefer), think of Formula 1 as the World Cup and the FIA as FIFA.
A circuit – a length of road that weaves a ribbon of tarmac before ending where it started – might be on closed-off public streets or at a dedicated race track.
