A points-scoring system is in place for the top 10 finishers of every Grand Prix to rank the drivers and teams over the season.
Should a driver win a race, they score 25 points for themselves and the team they drive for to add to their season tally.
There are 18 points for second place, 15 for third, 12 for fourth, 10 for fifth, 8 for sixth, 6 for seventh, 4 for eighth, 2 for ninth, and 1 for tenth place.
An additional point is available for the driver who sets the fastest lap in a Grand Prix, but only if they finish in the top 10.
The only other point-scoring opportunity comes in the aforementioned Sprint weekends, where in 2023, the top eight finishers scored points, with first place picking up 8 points and eighth taking home 1.
The teams share any points either of their two drivers score in a race, meaning 44 points are on offer on a standard race weekend should they finish in first and second places, with one of their cars also taking the fastest lap point.
