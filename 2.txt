Rather than haphazardly racing on random roads in each nation, rules established in 1989 dictate that each race would run for 305 km or 190 miles.
Each circuit's length will vary, but an F1 race will see the drivers repeatedly lap the track until they complete 305 km. When they reach that point, the next time they cross the finish line will end the Grand Prix.
The sole exception to this rule is Monaco's extraordinarily tight and twisty street circuit, which runs for 260 km instead.
